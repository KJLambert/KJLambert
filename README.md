👋 Hi, I’m Kyle
-----------------------------
- 👀 I’m interested in Science/biology. Especially genomes of small things like microbes, viruses, cells, and insects, and applying data science technologies to study or control them.
- 💞️ I’m open to collaborations. Primary experience so far is in microbial genomics research.
- 📫 I can be reached at klmbrt88@gmail.com
- 🔨 Working on a portfolio to include examples of workflows (nextflow, snakemake, bayerclaw) python, R, and SQL queries. Potentially expanding into Applications and cloud infrastructure.
- 🌱 I’m always learning uses of new cloud technologies, ML, API's, and databases.
  
Here is the never ending list of technologies that I want to explore in more depth (I have a learning addiction):
langchain, dbt, airflow
